Here, radix_sort() takes an array arr as input and performs the radix sort algorithm on it by repeatedly calling the counting_sort() function for every digit.

The counting_sort() function takes two arguments, the array arr to be sorted and the exponent exp which represents the digit position we are sorting by. It first initializes an output array of the same length as the input array and a count array of size 10 to keep track of the occurrences of each digit. It then iterates through the input array and increments the count of the digit at the current exponent position. After that, it modifies the count array so that it contains the actual position of each digit in the output array. Finally, it builds the output array by iterating backwards through the input array and placing each element in its correct position in the output array based on the count array. Finally, the sorted output array is copied back into the input array.

Overall, the radix_sort() function will sort the input array in ascending order.
